1.Clustered Index
2.Non Clustered Index

1.DML trigger
2.DDL trigger

- Transaction 

1.Implicit transaction
2.Explicit transaction
3.Autocommit transaction

Indexing :

Organize the data in DB
Improve the data access and efficiency 

1.Clutered Index : 

- Physical sorting of data 
- closely associated with the primary key 
- 1 clustered index in a table 

2.Nonclustered Index :

- Logical grouping of data 
- Closely associated with unique key 
- 0 - 999 nonclustered index in a table 


Triggers:

- database object that is executed automatically when an event occurs

virtual tables : inserted , deleted

Types :
 DML : Insert / update / delete
 DDL : create / drop 
 Logon  Trigger : Server level
 
 - trigger clauses : FOR / AFTER / INSTEADOF


 Transaction  : 

 - set of T-SQL statements that execute as single unit
 - ACID Properties

 Atomicity - everything happens or nothing 
 Consistency - Read only the commited data 
 Isolation - independent , each transaction is seperated from others 
 Durability - Data is preserved or persistent even when there is any network / server / other failures 

 Types 

1.Implicit transaction
2.Explicit transaction
3.Autocommit transaction


commands : 

Rollback - revert
commit - save 
savepoint - save and it can be rollback in the future
